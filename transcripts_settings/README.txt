This module packages together default settings from the Transcripts module as
a feature that can be installed on any Drupal 7 website. In addition, the module
wraps the feature and its admin interface up into a "space". This allows
Transcripts settings to be different for different portions of a site. For
example, using spaces_og, different groups can have different configuration
settings.
