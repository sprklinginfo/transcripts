TRANSCRIPTS EDITOR DISABLE

Requires: Flag (http://drupal.org/project/flag)

Use this module to enable certain roles to freeze the editing of specific
transcripts. For example, you may want to disable online transcript editing
when a transcript is downloaded for offline editing.

To administer this module, go to admin/structure/flags

Find the 'transcripts_editor_disable' flag and enable it for the content types
that have transcripts. The flag will then appear under the transcript link on 
the node edit form for those who have permissions to set the flag.
